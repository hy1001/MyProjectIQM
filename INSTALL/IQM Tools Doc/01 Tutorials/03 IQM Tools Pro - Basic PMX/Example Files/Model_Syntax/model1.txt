********** MODEL NAME
Example: 1 compartment model with nonlinear elimination

********** MODEL NOTES
Example ODE based model with a single input and a single output.
The input is on state Ac.

Since INPUT1 is not defined as parameter, during import a parameter INPUT1 
will be added the model with the default value 0.

It is GOOD MODELING PRACTICE to define the units of the elements here in 
the notes:

Time unit:   hours
INPUT unit:  ug
OUTPUT unit: ng/ml

It is also good modeling practice to annotate the units in the model below.

********** MODEL STATES
d/dt(Ac)  = -VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc) + F*INPUT1    % (ug/hour)

********** MODEL PARAMETERS
VMAX = 1      % (ug/hour) Maximum rate of elimination    
KM   = 1      % (ng/ml)   At this concentration elimiation rate is half VMAX
Vc   = 1      % (L)       Central volume   
F    = 0.6    % (.)       Relative bioavailability

********** MODEL VARIABLES
Cc      = Ac/Vc % (ng/ml) Plasma concentration
OUTPUT1 = Cc    % (ng/ml) Output variable

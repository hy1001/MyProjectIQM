[Name]
WT_2_stimulation

[Notes]
We used wild-type cells and subjected them to a long duration stimulation. 
The stimulation corresponds to the reaction rate from R => Ract. Here the 
reaction vStim has the form of a pulse, which starts at time=0 and ends at 
time=2 (durStim) and has a magnitude of magStim = 2.

We measured the amount of activated Rhodopsins (Ract) and the amount of 
the complex GactPDEact.

The names below (Ract, GactPDEact) need to be the same as the corresponding 
component names in the model. Furthermore the units need to be the same. 

NOTE: An amount of molecules < 1 is physically impossible. But just think 
about that using deterministic simulation we obtain a mean of many 
realizations.

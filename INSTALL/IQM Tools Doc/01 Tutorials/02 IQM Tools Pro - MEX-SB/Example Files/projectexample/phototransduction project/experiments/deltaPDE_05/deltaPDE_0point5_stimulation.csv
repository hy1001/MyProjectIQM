[Name]
deltaPDE_0point5_stimulation

[Notes]
We used PDE-knock-out cells and subjected them to a medium duration 
stimulation. The stimulation corresponds to the reaction rate from 
R => Ract. Here the reaction vStim has the form of a pulse, which 
starts at time=0 and ends at time=0.5 (durStim) and has a magnitude 
of magStim = 2.

We measured the amount of activated Rhodopsins (Ract). Since PDE is 0, 
the GactPDEact complex can not appear and thus does not need to be 
measured (maybe only for validation of the successful k/o... but it 
is not done here).

The names below (Ract, GactPDEact) need to be the same as the corresponding
component names in the model. Furthermore the units need to be the same. 

NOTE: An amount of molecules < 1 is physically impossible. But just think 
about that using deterministic simulation we obtain a mean of many 
realizations.
